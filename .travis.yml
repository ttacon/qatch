# DO NOT MODIFY DIRECTLY
# You can configure the travis build by modifying the package.json's install-files directives, or by
# making changes to the travis-config-shared-modules package.


# Use Trusty for a C++11 compiler, for our native dependencies:
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs/#Node.js-v4-(or-io.js-v3)-compiler-requirements
# But it's also the future of Travis anyway.
dist: trusty

# Containers for faster startup, also we don't need sudo.
sudo: false

# Setup our language requirements.
language: node_js
node_js:
  - 8.9.3

# For faster builds and tests.
cache:
  directories:
    # Location of npm cache per https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/cache#cache. Shared by npx per
    # https://github.com/zkat/npx/tree/6e89dbd5989366e52d3810692b1ab5889a05fbad#description.

# As it says.
install:
  - npx npm@$NPM_VERSION ci

  
# Don't build pushes to branches other than our published branches. This also affects PR
# builds since they test merge commits. If we didn't have this config, every time we pushed
# to a branch involved in a PR, Travis would run both a PR build and a push build, consuming
# extra concurrent builds.
branches:
  only:
    - master

# Include a safety hatch if needed.
